# Mini Photo Editor

Simple photo editor built with pure Python. I have used `png.py` file which was written by Johann C. Rocholl. This simple photo editor provides functionality to png formatted images. There are very limited number of features, yet very interesting features, in this editor.

- Editing brightness of the image
- Editing contrast of the image
- Blurring the image
- Edge detection, both for x and y axes
- Merge two pictures of the same size together

## For this project, you need

- Python 3.9.5
- Numpy 1.20.0
- Cpython - 0.0.6
